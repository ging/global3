boxy - General purpose copycat Facebook dialog/overlay

== DESCRIPTION:

boxy continues my tradition of derivative jQuery plugins ending in the letter 'y'
(Actually, I was going to call it Facebox but another rascal beat me to it).

It's a general purpose dialog box with support for multiple visible instances,
drag'n'drop, size tweening, AJAX loading and automatic generation of
confirmation/question boxes. Designed with "applications" in mind, so there's
a pretty decent API for manipulating instances. No support as yet for Lightbox
style galleries but patches for this behaviour are most certainly welcome.

== HOMEPAGE & DOCUMENTATION:

This is where all of the examples are, I'd advise checking it out:
